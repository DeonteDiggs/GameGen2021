# GameGen 2021

This repository is created for the game *"Wave of Wanderers"* by the team **Flying Sailors** for the Virtual GameJam 2021. 

### Game Objective
The objective of the game is to complete all the levels protecting the ships by dodging and shooting at the obstacles on the way. Game overs once all the ships are destoryed. 
A free mode is also offered in the game which allows the player to play endlessly for the survival.

### Game Mechanics
The game starts with 3 boats, and there is a windblower cloud attached to each ship which allows the player to move the ship in the direction the wind is blown on a ship on a keyboard Z press. The windblower could be moved around 360 degrees using the right and left arrow keys. The shooting functionality is triggered by the press of X on the keyboard and is useful to destory the obstacles. The player also has the option to switch between the various ships using up and down arrow keys.  

### To Play the Game
The easiest way to play the game is to download the setup from the installer folder. Another way is to clone the repo and start the executable file from the releases folder which would not require any setup.
